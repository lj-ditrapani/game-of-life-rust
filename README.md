Conway's Game of Life on 2-D toroidal grid in rust

My first rust program.  I would really appreciate feedback on idiomatic rust.

You can change the const declaration to adjust the size of the grid.

TODO
----

- Set cells method to easily turn on a list of cells to initialize the board.
- Make some demo programs selectable from list.
- Consider making the cells 4 X 2 block of chars instead of 2 X 1.
  ```
  |  | /--\
  |__| \--/
  ```
- Make a crate?
