Conway's Game of Life on 2-D toroidal grid in rust.

An interactive command-line experience.

Steps to success:

1. Start program with `cargo run`
2. Select a demo
3. ????
4. PROFIT!!!

My first rust program.  I would really appreciate feedback on idiomatic rust.

You can change the const declaration to adjust the size of the grid.
